# DDLCPCYDecompiler
 A simple console app to get unity asset bundles back from .cy files for Doki Doki
 
 Just meant for messing around, don't take this seriously, I used this for practice with non-text files

# Install Directions:
* If you need help, contact me on GitHub, Discord DMs (btelnyy#8395) or my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/P22tFkjTm3)
* The server is general dev hub, so its not all DDLC in there, just use it for support.
Download the latest file from the release section [here](https://github.com/BTELNYY/DDLCPCYDecompiler/releases/latest)
1. Extract this .zip file
2. Copy all of the extracted files into the same directory as your game (where `Doki Doki Literature Club Plus.exe` is located)
* What you should see on a successful install

3. Run the app you just copied
4. You will receive a prompt where you must type either `all` or `single`
* `single` implies you must enter a file name (the .cy is optional)
* `all` will just decrypt all of the files
5. Assuming there are no errors, you will need to navigate to `Doki Doki Literature Club Plus_Data\StreamingAssets\AssetBundles\Windows\`
6. the decrypted files will have the same name but have a .bin extension. These can be opened by external tools. (You can also rename them, if you want.)!
